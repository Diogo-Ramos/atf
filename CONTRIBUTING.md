## Ways to contribute

There are lots of ways to contribute. Here's a few ideas:

* Comment on some of the project's [open issues](https://github.com/jacebenson/atf/issues). Have you experienced the same problem? Know a work around? Do you have a suggestion for how the feature could be better?
* Find [an open issue](https://github.com/jacebenson/atf/issues) (especially [those labeled `help-wanted`](https://github.com/jacebenson/atf/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Ahelp-wanted)), and submit a proposed fix. If it's your first pull request, I promise I won't bite, and I'm glad to answer any questions.<br/>

* Help evaluate [open pull requests](https://github.com/jacebenson/atf/pulls), by testing the changes locally and reviewing what's proposed.

### Actually Contributing

1.  Fork the repo
2.  Install the fork on to your [personal developer instance](https://developer.servicenow.com/app.do#!/home).
3.  Pick an issue. And in the scope do the work.
4.  When done commit the change
5.  Then push then change back to git
6.  Now that your fork has the updates. Then make a pull request.

## Submitting a pull request

### Pull requests generally

* The smaller the proposed change, the better. If you'd like to propose two unrelated changes, submit two pull requests.

* The more information, the better. Make judicious use of the pull request body. Describe what changes were made, why you made them, and what impact they will have for users.

* If this is your first pull request, it may help to [understand GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).

### Submitting a pull request via github.com

Many small changes can be made entirely through the github.com web interface.

1. Click "Create pull request"
2. Add a descriptive title and detailed description for your proposed change. The more information the better.
3. Click "Create pull request"

That's it! You'll be automatically subscribed to receive updates as others review your proposed change and provide feedback.

## Proposing updates to the documentation

We want the Hugo documentation to be the best it can be. We've open-sourced our docs and we welcome any pull requests if you find it lacking.

## A thank you

Thanks! Hacking on this scoped application should be fun. If you find any of this hard to figure out, let us know so we can improve our process or documentation!
